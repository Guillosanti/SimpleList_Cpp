# SimpleList_Cpp
This is a simple C++ file where the program accepts any item (as string) and will build a list. The items will be organized maintaining the same order the user has added them. Is possible to see the complete list and delete a specific item from the list. The list will be never stored in any place in the PC, i.e., once the program has closed, the complete list will be erased.
